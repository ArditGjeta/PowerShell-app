"# PowerShell-app" 
Monitoring Tool is a module created by me. In my daily work, I was responsible for manually checking the performance and error logs of each machine. This process was incredibly time-consuming, as it required individual attention to every machine. To streamline this task, I conceived the idea of creating a single module that could be easily imported into PowerShell. With this module, you can remotely access other machines to monitor their performance, view warnings, and check errors in their event logs. This project is still in its early stages of development, and I am actively working on it.
